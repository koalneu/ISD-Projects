# Implementation of the Login, Register and Update user details

New Table to the database has been added and a new java model has been added to contain the accesslogs function (NOT SURE IF IT IS CORRECT BUT I PLACED IT THERE FOR NOW SINCE WE WILL HAVE TO BE USING IT SEVERAL TIMES), THIS MUST BE ADDED YOURSELF as my DB is local and doesnt work anyways
